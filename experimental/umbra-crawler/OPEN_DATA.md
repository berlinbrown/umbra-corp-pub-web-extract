Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained on a variety of extensive datasets to enhance their language processing capabilities. Notable datasets include:

Common Crawl: An open repository that scrapes vast portions of the internet, providing a comprehensive snapshot of web content. LLM developers often filter and process this data to create refined subsets suitable for training.
FACCT CONFERENCE

WebText: Curated by OpenAI, this dataset comprises content from web pages that were highly upvoted on Reddit, aiming to capture high-quality web content.
DATAMAN AI

C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus): Developed by Google, C4 is a cleaned version of Common Crawl, designed to remove low-quality content and retain high-quality English text for training language models.
DATAMAN AI

SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset): A reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed on a set of Wikipedia articles, with corresponding answers. It's widely used for training and evaluating question-answering systems.
DATAMAN AI

SWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations): A dataset for evaluating grounded commonsense inference, where models choose the most plausible continuation of a given scenario.

RSS to CSV Conversion Tools:

RSS.app: Services like RSS.app offer tools to convert RSS feeds into CSV format, allowing for easier data manipulation and integration into other applications.
RSS.APP
Exporting RSS Feeds from Applications:

Microsoft Outlook: If you're using an application like Microsoft Outlook to manage your RSS feeds, you can export your collection to an OPML file, which can then be shared or imported into other RSS readers. Instructions for this process are available on Microsoft's support page.
