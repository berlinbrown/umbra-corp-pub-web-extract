# Analysis of the Web

As of January 2025, there are over 1.1 billion websites on the internet, with only about 17% 
 (approximately 193 million) actively maintained and visited.

The total number of web pages is even more substantial. While the exact count is difficult to determine due to the dynamic nature of the internet,
  estimates suggest there are more than 50 billion web pages.

It's important to note that these numbers are constantly changing as new websites and pages are created and others become inactive or are removed.
